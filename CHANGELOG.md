## 1.0.2

- Recover automatically when `tunneld` refuses to create an RSD tunnel:
  `xcross flutter run` now mounts the Developer Disk Image and starts a
  lockdown tunnel itself instead of stalling 60s and silently degrading to
  the userspace transport.
- Say why hot reload is unavailable, and answer `r`/`R` with that reason
  instead of ignoring the keypress.

## 1.0.1

- Add `xcross auth clear` to sign out: deletes the saved App Store Connect
  key, the Apple ID session and its machine attestation state, and every
  certificate, private key, and provisioning profile xcross minted.
- Reject unexpected positional arguments to `xcross auth` instead of silently
  starting an Apple ID login.
- Accept certificates and profiles Apple minted up to an hour ahead of a
  lagging host clock, and name both clocks in the error when it is worse.

## 1.0.0

- Build, sign, install, launch, and hot-reload Flutter iOS apps natively on
  Linux and Windows.
- Support Swift Package Manager Flutter plugins on both hosts.
- Apple ID/password login on Linux and Windows via Android ADI / Anisette, or
  App Store Connect API keys on either host.
- Remove the xtool runtime completely; xcross now owns Darwin SDK setup and
  uses the native device pipeline.
- Add `xcross --version`, stamped from the git tag at release build time.
- Add `xcross update` to self-update an installed xcross from the latest
  GitHub release, verified against the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- Print a cached, once-a-day "update available" hint on other commands;
  disable it with `XCROSS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`.
