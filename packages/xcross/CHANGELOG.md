## 1.0.1

- Add `xcross auth clear` to sign out: deletes the saved App Store Connect
  key, the Apple ID session and its machine attestation state, and every
  certificate, private key, and provisioning profile xcross minted.
- Reject unexpected positional arguments to `xcross auth` instead of silently
  starting an Apple ID login.
- Accept certificates and profiles Apple minted up to an hour ahead of a
  lagging host clock, and name both clocks in the error when it is worse.

## 1.0.0

- Build, sign, install, launch, and hot-reload Flutter iOS apps natively on
  Linux and Windows.
- Support Swift Package Manager Flutter plugins on both hosts.
- Apple ID/password login on Linux and Windows via Android ADI / Anisette, or
  App Store Connect API keys on either host.
- Remove the xtool runtime completely; xcross now owns Darwin SDK setup and
  uses the native device pipeline.
